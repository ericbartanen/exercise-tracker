# React-Exercise-Tracker

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/ericbartanen/React-Exercise-Tracker
cd React-Exercise-Tracker
```
You'll need to open two terminals to start the backend and frontend...

Terminal one:
```
cd exercise-api
npm install
npm start
```
Terminal two:
```
cd exercise-ui
npm install
npm start
```

## To Do 
- [ ] Host on AWS.
- [ ] Rather than collect individual exercises, create exercise routines.
